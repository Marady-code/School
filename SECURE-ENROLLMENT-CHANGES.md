# Secure School Enrollment Implementation Changes

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to implement a secure user registration workflow that follows real-world school enrollment processes:

1. In-person enrollment where parents/students physically visit the school
2. Admin-controlled user creation with appropriate roles
3. Secure credential distribution via email or print
4. Required password change on first login

## Files Modified

### Controllers

1. **AuthenticationController**

   - Removed public registration endpoint (`/auth/register`)
   - Updated login endpoint to handle password change requirement flag

2. **UserController**

   - Secured the self-registration endpoint (`/users/register`) by adding admin role requirement

3. **New EnrollmentController**
   - Created new controller dedicated to the secure enrollment process
   - Added endpoints for creating students, teachers, and parents
   - Added endpoints for first-login password change
   - Added endpoint for credential printing

### Data Models

1. **User**

   - Added `passwordChangeRequired` flag
   - Added `lastPasswordChangeDate` field to track password changes

2. **New AdminUserCreationDTO**

   - Created new DTO for admin-based user creation
   - Added role-specific fields (student, teacher, parent)
   - Added flags for credential delivery preferences

3. **New FirstLoginPasswordChangeDTO**

   - Created new DTO for handling first-time password changes

4. **AuthenticationResponse**
   - Added `passwordChangeRequired` flag to notify clients of needed password change

### Services

1. **UserServiceImpl**

   - Added `createUserByAdmin` method for admin-controlled user creation
   - Added `changePasswordFirstLogin` method for first-login password changes
   - Added `isPasswordChangeRequired` method to check password status

2. **EmailServiceImpl**

   - Enhanced welcome email to include credential information
   - Updated email templates for better security messaging

3. **AuthenticationService**
   - Updated authentication process to check for required password change
   - Enhanced token generation to include password change status

### Database

1. **Migration Script**
   - Created migration script to add new columns:
     - `password_change_required`
     - `last_password_change_date`

## Security Improvements

1. **Removed Public Registration**

   - Eliminated open registration endpoints
   - All user creation now requires admin privileges

2. **Temporary Password Flow**

   - System generates secure temporary passwords for new accounts
   - Passwords are delivered securely via email or printed credentials
   - No persistent storage of plaintext passwords

3. **First Login Security**

   - Users must change passwords on first login
   - Enforces password strength requirements
   - Tracks password change history

4. **Role Enforcement**
   - Explicit role assignment by administrators
   - Type-specific endpoints for creating students, teachers, and parents

## Testing

1. **Enrollment Workflow Test Script**

   - Created PowerShell script for testing the enrollment workflow
   - Covers admin login, user creation, and password change flow

2. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive administrator guide for enrollment process

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Integration**

   - Update frontend to prompt for password change when required
   - Implement credential printing UI

2. **Additional Security Features**
   - Consider adding password expiration policies
   - Implement account lockout after failed login attempts
